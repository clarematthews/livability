# Boilerplate Compojure Project using Enlive for Templating

A boilerplate project for creating a web app using [Compojure][1] and [Enlive][2]

## Prerequisites
* You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.5.0 or above installed.
* You will need [Java][1] (JDK).
* If using IntelliJ as your IDE you will need the [Cursive][3] plugin  _(remove other clojure plugins)_

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run
    
To access the site, go to your browser and open up `http://localhost:8080`.

## Structure

The application uses Clojure on the back-end and [Http-kit][5] is used as the http-client.

### Templating
In order to create views, the application uses [Enlive][2] to populate template HTML files
